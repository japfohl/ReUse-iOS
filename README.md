# Corvallis ReUse 

## Project History
In early 2010, the Corvallis Sustainability Coalition created the Corvallis-Area ReUse Directory. The purpose of the Corvallis Reuse and Repair Directory, (Corvallis ReUse), is to provide Corvallis and the outlying community a way to easily locate organizations that will take items for repair, reusable items that can be sold to the public as used items, and items to recycle. You can <a href="http://sustainablecorvallis.org/action-teams/waste-prevention/corvallis-area-reuse-directory">download the current directory</a> from the Corvallis Sustainability Coalition website.

## The Corvallis Reuse and Repair Website
You can also <a href="http://app.sustainablecorvallis.org/">browse the Corvallis Reuse and Repair directory online</a>.

## Corvallis ReUse iOS App
The Corvallis ReUse iOS app was created to serve as a user-friendly alternative to the PDF directory. Working with Oregon State University students, the Corvallis Sustainability Coalition has released the directory as both an Android and iOS app. 

## iOS App files
The code for the iOS app can be found in team Reticulumâ€™s ReUse github repository, or more specifically at https://github.com/OSU-CS467-W2017-Reticulum-ReUseProject/iOS_App. The iOS app was developed using Xcode. To open the project, download the zip file and open the CRRD.xcodeproj file in Xcode on a mac. Once the file is open, simply choose the device simulator you want (iPhone, iPad, etc) and run the app. All of the files needed to compile and run the iOS app (Including device simulators) are included in Xcode.
